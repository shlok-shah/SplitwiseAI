## Introduction üìñ

Splitwise-AI is a smart web app that automates bill splitting using image processing, OCR, and AI.
Built with Streamlit, it processes bill photos, extracts key details, and integrates directly with the Splitwise API to record and split expenses among group members, uses Google Gemini for interpreting bill data, offering faster and more accurate extractions.
